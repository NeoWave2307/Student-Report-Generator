Apache Maven is a build automation and dependency management tool for Java projects.
Instead of manually downloading JAR files (like poi-ooxml.jar) and adding them to your project, Maven does it for youâ€”automatically.
With Maven, pom.xml file downloads all required libraries (and their dependencies), manages versions, compiles, packages, and runs your code with simple commands

This repository is for the
[Build a Java app with Maven](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-java-app-with-maven/)
tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

The results of these tests are saved to a
JUnit XML report.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `jenkins/scripts` subdirectory
contains a shell script with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Deliver" stage of your Pipeline.
